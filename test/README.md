# `/test`

Unit tests live here.

Run in the root directory by running:

```bash
source bin/activate # If you are not already in your virtualenv
nosetests
```

- `base.py` contains `TestingTemplate`, which is the baseclass for all test cases.
- `test_routes.py` is an example test suite, for the routes.
